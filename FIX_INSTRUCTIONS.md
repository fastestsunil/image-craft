### Try Direct Cloudinary Test:

In the console, paste and run this:

```javascript
// Test Cloudinary directly
fetch('https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/dpqlorjcj/image/upload', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: (() => {
    const fd = new FormData();
    fd.append(
      'file',
      'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506905925346-21bda4d32df4?w=400'
    );
    fd.append('upload_preset', 'imageCraft');
    fd.append('format', 'png');
    return fd;
  })(),
})
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);
```

This tests if Cloudinary is working directly.
